# CS3733-IP2
## Welcome To My IP2!
This is a guide for how to use my IP2. When you succesfully install all the modules required, you can run the program.
## 1) Start Page
At the start of the program, you will land on the home page. Just type in an event name and submit to get started. This resets the whole auction, so when it ends you land on this page again

## 2) Pre Auction
When you land on this page, you will only be able to add, remove, and view Items. On the right of the screen is where you can add all items. Please make sure all values are filled out with valid input, or the system will alert you that you need to fix something. Once you add the item, it will appear on the left of the screen, where you can click each individual item to view all of its information in the middle of the screen. You can also remove any item by pressing remove. Once you have all the items you need, press start auction.

## 3) Auction
Once the auction is started, you will not be able to remove items. Click which item you want to start with on the left hand side of the screen, and click start auction in the middle of the screen under the information of the item. Once an auction starts for an item, you will be able to add bids by inputting bid information on the right side of the screen. Once you add a bid and an item is selected, you can view all its bids on the bottom of the screen. Once you are satisfied with the bids, you can click sell item to sell the item for the bid amount - initial bid. The total funds will be updated at the top of the screen. Do this for all the items, and you will be able to end the auction. You can view all sold items at the bottom of the screen, and click any to view all its information and bids. 

## 4) End Auction
Once you end the auction, you will be taken to the home page. There, you can restart with a new event. 

## 5) Test Cases
When I did the test cases I got 90 for overall and between 80-90 for everything else. Please make sure you have Happy-DOM installed and other necessary modules installed. It only worked with the stuff in the config files and Happy-DOM.
