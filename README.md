# CS3733-IP2
## Welcome To My IP2!
This is a guide for how to use my IP2. When you succesfully install all the modules required, you can run the program. Please make sure the window for the program is in full screen or this guide will not make sense. The video below is me running the program according to the rubric. Everything worked properly. If you need help going through this refer to the notes and video below.

## The Components
There are five different components on the main screen. After the start page, you will see them. On the top from left to right there is: Current Items, Current Item, Add Item/Bid. On the bottom from left to right there is: Sold Items, Current Bids.
-  The Current Items component shows all the current items. Pre auction, this is where you can view and remove items you have added. To view them, click an item to put it on the Current Item component. During the auction, this is where you can view the items and select them to view them. Once an item is sold, it is removed from this component
-  The Current Item component shows all the information about an item. Once an item is clicked from either the Current Items list or the Sold Items list, all its information is put here. The top shows the name, the middle shows the initial bid, and the bottom shows the description. When the auction has started, you can select an item from the Current Items list, and a button appears on the bottom of the component letting you start the auction for that specific item. Clicking another item will still show it, but you will not be able to start the auction for that item or sell it until the current auction for the current item is over. Once the item has a bid higher than its initial bid, you will be able to sell it by pressing the Sell Item button on this component
-  The Add Item/Bid component has two uses. Pre auction, you can add items by inputting all necessary information and clicking Add Item. When the auction starts and an item is being auctioned, you can add bids for that item when it is selected. However, if you select an item that isnt being auctioned, you will not be able to add bids.
- The Sold Items component shows all the items sold with their name, final bids name, and final bids amount. You can select an item from this list to view its description and the bids it had.
- The Current Bids component displays both current and past bids. When an item is being auctioned, you can select the item to view its current bids. When you select an item that has been sold, you can view the past bids for that item. 

## 1) Start Page
At the start of the program, you will land on the home page. Just type in an event name and submit to get started. This resets the whole auction, so when it ends you land on this page again

## 2) Pre Auction
When you land on this page, you will only be able to add, remove, and view Items. On the right of the screen via the Add Item/Bid component is where you can add all items. Please make sure all values are filled out with valid input, or the system will alert you that you need to fix something. Once you add the item, it will appear on the left of the screen on the Current Items component, where you can click each individual item to view all of its information in the middle of the screen on the Current Item component. You can also remove any item by pressing remove. Once you have all the items you need, press start auction at the top of the screen.

## 3) Auction
Once the auction is started, you will not be able to remove items. Click which item you want to start with on the left hand side of the screen via the Current Items component, and click start auction in the middle of the screen on the Current Item component. Once an auction starts for an item, you will be able to add bids by inputting bid information on the right side of the screen via the Add Item/Bid component. Once you add a bid and an item is selected, you can view all its bids on the bottom of the screen via the Current Bids component. Once you are satisfied with the bids, you can click sell item to sell the item for the bid amount - initial bid via the button on the Current Item component. The total funds will be updated at the top of the screen. Do this for all the items, and you will be able to end the auction. You can view all sold items at the bottom of the screen via the Sold Item component, and click any to view all its information and bids. 

## 4) End Auction
Once you end the auction, you will be taken to the home page. There, you can restart with a new event. 

## 5) Test Cases
When I did the test cases I got 90 for overall and between 80-90 for everything else. Please make sure you have Happy-DOM installed and other necessary modules installed. It only worked with the stuff in the config files and Happy-DOM.
